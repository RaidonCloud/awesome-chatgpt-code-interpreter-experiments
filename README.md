## 👋 hello

We aim to push ChatGPT + Code Interpreter to its limits, show you what's possible and unlock your creativity! Well, and have a lot of fun doing it! 🔥

## 💻 code interpreter

Code Interpreter is an official ChatGPT [plugin](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins) for data analytics, image conversions, editing code, and more. Since July 6th, 2023, it has been available to all ChatGPT Plus users. It provides OpenAI models with a working Python interpreter in a sandboxed, firewalled execution environment. Importantly, it is possible to upload and download files.

## ⚠️ limitations

- No internet access.
- You can upload a maximum of 100 MB. `(*)`
- Runs only Python code. `(*)`
- Does not allow installation of external Python packages. `(*)`
- When the environment dies, you lose the entire state. Links that allowed you to download files stopped working.

`(*)` - it is possible to bypass these restrictions

## 💁🏻‍♂️ pro tips

- Always ask CI to make sure that import and variables are defined. They are constantly disappearing from the context.
- Try not to print too many logs and results (like embedding values). They can consume your context window very quickly.
- Always verify that the files are still in the environment.
- Add `notalk;justgo` to the end of your prompts.

## ⛓️ jailbreaks

### Install external Python packages

Code Interpreter has a set of pre-installed Python packages. Since CI does not have access to the Internet, you cannot install packages from outside the environment. ChatGPT will also not allow you to install add-on packages via `.whl` files.

<details close>
<summary>👉 steps</summary>

1. Upload your `.whl` file and ask ChatGPT to install it.

### Running Java Script app through Code Interpreter

Code Interpreter is an experimental ChatGPT plugin that can write Python to a Jupyter Notebook and execute it in a sandbox. This makes it impossible to execute code written in a language other than Python.

### Running YOLOv8 object detector inside Code Interpreter

So many things are stopping you from running [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) inside Code Interpreter. Let's start with the fact that YOLOv8 is not pre-installed in the Code Interpreter environment. It is also impossible to install with the standard `pip install ultralytics` command because we cannot access the Internet inside Code Interpreter. And even if you overcome all these obstacles, ChatGPT will constantly convince you that your dreams are impossible to realize.

<details close>
<summary>👉 steps</summary>

1. Download the Ultralytics `.whl` file from PyPI to your local machine. All mandatory YOLOv8 dependencies are already installed in the Code Interpreter environment. We use the `--no-deps` flag to download the `.whl` file only for the `ultralytics` pip package. 

    ```bash
    pip download ultralytics --no-deps
    ```

2. Download YOLOv8 [weights](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov8n.pt) to your local machine.

3. Prepare a `.zip` file with the structure described below.

    ```
    yolo /
    ├── yolov8n.pt
    ├── ultralytics-8.0.132-py3-none-any.whl
    └-─ data /
        ├── doge-1.jpeg
        ├── doge-2.jpeg
        └── doge-3.jpeg
    ```

4. Before we begin, let's confirm we can import `torch` without errors. If we fail to take this step, there is no point in going further. Code Interpreter may not want to execute this command at first. We have to ask it nicely. Possibly more than once.

    <img width="600" src="https://github.com/SkalskiP/awesome-chatgpt-code-interpreter-experiments/assets/26109316/ad94819a-2093-4f9b-ac5d-9721c0bf2605">
    
    <br>
    <br>

5. Upload `yolo.zip` into ChatGPT and provide instructions to unzip the file and install `ultralytics` using `.whl` file.

    > Please unzip the file I just uploaded. It should contain `yolov8n.pt` file, `ultralytics-8.0.132-py3-none-any.whl` file, and `data` directory. List the content of `yolo` directory to confirm I'm right. Run `pip install --no-deps ultralytics-8.0.132-py3-none-any.whl` to install `ultralytics` package. At the end run the code below to confirm `ultralytics` package was installed correctly. 
    >

    > import ultralytics

## 🧪 experiments

### Detect and track face on the video

OpenAI does not allow access to pre-trained deep learning models in the Code Interpreter environment. However, it is still possible to detect and track objects. We just need to be more creative. [Haar Cascade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar-like_feature) was one of the most popular approaches to face detection in old-school computer vision.

### Classification of images from the MNIST dataset

The [MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset) dataset is a widely-used collection of handwritten digits that is used to teach computers how to recognize and understand numbers. It consists of thousands of examples of handwritten numbers from 0 to 9, created by different people in different styles. The images are very small - only 28x28 pixels. Therefore, they are great for training in an environment with limited resources.

<details close>
<summary>👉 steps</summary>

1. Upload the MNIST dataset into the Code Interpreter environment.

2. only 10% of the original dataset is loaded to save hard drive and memory space.
